# GameOfLife
Implements and replicates the concepts of Conway's Game of Life Created by Zachary Goniea in 2021

This project's main focus was on the multiple use cases of nested arrays and the process of reading from files. For file-reading, error checking
obviously becomes necessary, so that was also a major portion of this project. Understaning of 2d arrays as well as deep copies were also of much import.

The program takes in inputed filename from the user, reads the file line by line, checks the current status of all "cells" to determine the next generation,
utilizes deep copies to create a new board of cells representing the next genration, and prints the new generation to the cosole.

Also included is a .zip with inputs so you can see for yourself what the program does! Remember to put the input files (not as a zip) in your main directory folder.
